<H1>The woodcutter and the axe </H1><hr>
<p> Long ago, there lived a woodcutter in a small village.</p>
<p> He was sincere in his work and very honest. </p>
 <p>Every day, he set out into the nearby forest to cut trees.</p>
 <p> He brought the woods back into the village and sold them out to a merchant and earn his money.</p>
<p>  He earned just about enough to make a living, but he was satisfied with his simple living.</p>
<p>One day, while cutting a tree near a river, his axe slipped out of his hand and fell into the river.</p> 
<p>  The river was so deep, he could not even think to retrieve it on his own.</p>
<p> He only had one axe which was gone into the river.</p>
<p> He became a very worried thinking how he will be able to earn his living now!  He was very sad and prayed to the Goddess.</p>
<p> He prayed sincerely so the Goddess appeared in front of him and asked, “What is the problem, my son?”</p>
<p> The woodcutter explained the problem and requested the Goddess to get his axe back.</p>
<p> The Goddess put her hand deep into the river and took out a silver axe and asked, “Is this your axe?”</p>
<p>  The Woodcutter looked at the axe and said “No”.</p>
<p>   So the Goddess put her hand back deep into the water again and showed a golden axe and asked, “Is this your axe?”</p>
<p>  The woodcutter looked at the axe and said “No”. </p>
<p> The Goddess said, “Take a look again Son, this is a very valuable golden axe, are you sure this is not yours?”</p>
<p>  The woodcutter said, “No, It’s not mine.  I can’t cut the trees with a golden axe.</p>
<p>  It’s not useful for me”.</p>
<p>The Goddess smiled and finally put her hand into the water again and took out his iron axe and asked, “Is this your axe?”</p>
<p>  To this, the woodcutter said, “Yes!  This is mine!  Thank you!”>/p>
<p>  The Goddess was very impressed with his honesty so she gave him his iron axe and also other two axes as a reward for his honesty.</p>
<H1> Moral:  Always be honest.  Honesty is always rewarded.</H1><HR>
